### Added

- The local db push command now runs a MySQL optimize command to fix any indexes that were corrupted during the import

## 3.0.0-beta.2 - 2022-04-15

### Updated

- Craft 4 compatibility, including:
- Complete rework of Volume and the new Filesystem objects
- Rewrite of pull and push-asset commands to support filesystems
- Allow mapping of Servd Filesystems to Local Folder filesystems to allow copy of assets between them
- Loads of changes to ImageTransforms and related Events
- A few changes to support the new craft-flysystem package

## 2.5.3 - 2022-04-11

### Added

- Support for video on the Asset Platform

### Fixed

- Don't break filename icons for non image files in the Craft CP assets view
- Additional fixes for yii debug bar's recent changes

## 2.5.2 - 2022-04-07

### Fixed

- Fixed an incompatibility with the latest release of yii2-debug which changed the way data is serialised, breaking our debug logs redis target.

## 2.5.1 - 2022-02-25

### Changed

- The option to skip the cache for logged in users now differentiates between users who have cp access and not - so front-end-only users don't have to have all static caching disabled when they log in.
- Background tasks for static cache purges now have a priority of 1025 in order to try to get them to run after more important things as they sometimes can take quite a while.

## 2.5.0 - 2022-01-28

### Added

- Added an optional integration with the feed-me plugin to allow feed logs to be pushed to standard log output. This allows Servd to collect and display them using its normal log aggregation services

### Updated

- Rearranged the plugin settings page so that it's a little more organised
- Removed README content and added a link to the relevant Servd docs page

## 2.4.20 - 2022-01-27

### Updated

- Significantly improve the performance of tag-based static cache clearing for sites with a very large number of unique URLs

## 2.4.19 - 2022-01-25

### Updated

- Fire an event in JS when CSRF tokens have been loaded into the DOM if using static caching

## 2.4.18 - 2022-01-24

### Updated

- Ensure objects passed into {% dynamicInclude %} contexts, that do not have an id set, are removed (because they can't be rehydrated later)
- [Craft CMS Hosting on Servd](https://servd.host)

## 2.4.17 - 2022-01-18

### Fixed

- 2.4.16 caused another bug when multiple blocks were loaded onto the same page. Now fixed.

## 2.4.16 - 2022-01-18

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug which caused only a subset of `dynamicInclude` blocks to be included in the `dynamicLoaded` JS event.

## 2.4.15 - 2022-01-07

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug (recently introduced by changes to users and permissions in Servd's nginx processes) which prevented static cache purges from working as expected in some circumstances.

## 2.4.14 - 2022-01-06

### Updated

- Changed the download timeout when syncing assets to/from local volumes to 300 seconds instead of the previous 30 seconds.

## 2.4.13 - 2022-01-03

### Fixed

- Image transforms alignments using the (e.g.) 'top-left' syntax were being ignored in Servd asset transform URLs. Now they are not.

## 2.4.12 - 2021-12-28

### Fixed

- Twig extensions were only being registered for 'site' requests which caused problems when rendering templates from a CLI command. This is now fixed.

## 2.4.11 - 2021-12-15

### Updated

- The event which fires when the plugin has loaded in any `{% dynamicInclude %}` content now includes a list of all the blocks which have been added to the DOM, allowing you to target them in JS and do things with them (like init alpine JS objects etc).

## 2.4.10 - 2021-11-25

### Updated

- Allowed Servd powered ImagerX transforms to work when passed an existing ImagerX model instead of an Asset. Not sure why you'd do it, but folk do, and now they can.

## 2.4.9 - 2021-11-18

### Updated

- Added a timeout to the redis connection which clears Servd's static cache. There are now some legitimate situations in which these components might not exist all of the time, but PHP doesn't necesserily know about it.

## 2.4.8 - 2021-10-20

### Updated

- Disabled SEOMatic's automatic meta inclusion in templates generated by dynamicInclude - they aren't needed and slow things down

## 2.4.7 - 2021-10-20

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with dynamicInclude blocks which are placed within a loop

## 2.4.6 - 2021-09-17

## 2.4.2 - 2021-09-03

### Updated

- Added a link to the Servd SMTP docs when the sendmail CP alert is shown. This provides information on why sendmail is disabled and also actionable alternative.

## 2.4.1 - 2021-08-27

### Added

- You can now disable image asset transforms and optimisations with a plugin setting. This can be useful if you're using another plugin or service to perform the necessary transforms and you only require the original image's URL.

## 2.4.0 - 2021-07-12

### Added

- You can now specify 'placeholder' on the 'dynamicInclude' tag, and combine with the 'endDynamicInclude' tag, in order to display placeholder content which is visible during dynamic content loading.

## 2.3.3 - 2021-07-09

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug with dynamicIncludes which prevented the plugin from automatically detecting the availability of ESI

## 2.3.2 - 2021-06-14

## 2.3.1 - 2021-06-11

### Fixed

- When the static cache is cleared, also clear all associated metadata. This ensures any cached 301/302 redirects are purged.
- dynamicInclude blocks whose responses contain multiple top level nodes no longer break things.

## 2.3.0 - 2021-05-06

### Added

- Support for super simple dynamic content in combination with static caching. Also supports zero-config ESI dynamic content if avaialble on Servd

## 2.2.6 - 2021-04-26

## 2.2.4 - 2021-03-31

## 2.2.3 - 2021-03-30

### Fixed

## 2.2.2 - 2021-03-25

### Updated

- Include the triggers for cache purges in the background task for informational purposes

## 2.1.11 - 2021-02-05

## 2.0.5 - 2021-01-05

> {note} This update contains a migration which attempts to maintain any existing custom domains which you have used in previous versions of the plugin. Please double check your volume settings after updating to make sure that this migration has had the intended effect.

### Added
- You can now define fully custom URL structures for source files and optimised images which make use of custom domains. You'll need to provide your own logic (in a Cloudflare worker or Lambda@edge) to proxy this request and convert the URL structure back to Servd's expected format.

### Updated

## 2.0.4 - 2020-12-14

### Added
- The data for the Yii2 Debug Bar will be stored in Redis instead of the filesystem, allowing it to work on ephemeral or load balanced environments.

## 2.0.3 - 2020-12-14

### Added
- You can now clear the CDN cache for the Servd Assets Platform by clicking a button in the Craft CP. This will cause any image transforms to be re-applied and any caches for original files will be destroyed.

## 2.0.2 - 2020-11-30

### Fixed
- CORS tokens were being injected into pages even when they were disabled. These overexicted tokens are now firmly back under control.

## 2.0.1 - 2020-11-13

### Fixed
- Graceful handling of a situation in which the $SERVD_ASSETS_ENVIRONMENT is explicitly set in the plugin settings, but the env var doesn't actually exist
- Fixed display of a control panel alert which prompts user to add appropriate plugin settings

## 2.0.0 - 2020-11-08

### Added
- ImageOptimize support for Servd assets platform
- ImagerX support for Servd assets platform (requires ImagerX Pro)
- Control panel warnings for Servd related misconfigurations

### Updated
- Large code refactor to plan for upcoming new features
- Moved Servd Project Slug and Security Key config param to plugin settings instead of volume settings

### Fixed
- Some things that previously broke, but nobody noticed 🤫
- No default env var fallback for $SERVD_ASSETS_ENVIRONMENT (#11)

### Removed
- Support for Servd's legacy asset platform

## 1.3.12 - 2020-10-17

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug introduced with Craft 3.5 which prevents assets being downloaded from the control panel

## 1.3.11 - 2020-09-11

### Updated
- Only asynchronously load CSRF tokens if there's an element on the page which will actually use it. Reduces precious PHP executions for statically cached sites.

## 1.3.10 - 2020-09-10

### Fixed
- Optimised assets with special characters in their filename were generating an incorrect security token because of some url encoding things. That is now longer the case and everyone can now safely include spaces, copyright symbols or aubergine emojis in their filenames.

## 1.3.9 - 2020-09-03

### Added
- Ability to override the automatically detected environment for assets. This allows, for E.G., developers to use the assets stored in their production environment whilst working locally.

## 1.3.8 - 2020-09-03

### Fixed
- Fixed a typo in the plugin settings

## 1.3.7 - 2020-08-25

- Ability to disable automatic static cache clearing or restrict it to only occur when entries are saved as part of a control panel request.

## 1.3.6 - 2020-08-07

### Added
- Ability to replace the domain used for optimised images. This allows the use of custom domains for assets stored within the Servd Assets Platform. [Read how].
